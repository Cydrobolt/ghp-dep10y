Dep10y: Create apps effortlessly, collaborate in realtime, load templates and more! 
Get up and running within 10 minutes.  Still learning how to code? No problem! Our templates and our intuitive interface make it easy to get started. Deploy to our DigitalOcean servers, and enjoy the breeze. Our servers are managed by `puppet`. Unlike traditional collaborative coding services, Dep10y does not "lag". You deploy to your own servers, or one of our virtual machines. Every node gets 512mbs of RAM, and a CPU core. 

Feel free to clone Dep10y and run it on your own server!
